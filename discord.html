	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>This is a landing page I made so I don't need to update fifteen thousand links when I need to change the discord invite.</p>
	<p>If you'd like to go to my Discord server, <a href="https://discord.gg/WUXsbGH">step right this way</a>.</p>
	<h2>Alternatives</h2>
	<p>Discord kinda sorta sucks, especially with them cozying up to blockchain bullshit lately. I'm not a huge fan of it, but I don't know what else to use.
		I don't want to use sketchy for-profit unproven Discord clones at this time, I'm not good at IRC, and I tried Matrix but don't like it too much.
		(Keep in mind that my Discord is mostly a chat room, and I don't keep a wealth of important information in there.)</p>
	<p>If you need help or support, but don't want to use Discord:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Leave a comment on the mod's CurseForge page. Some modders don't like providing support over the comments section, but I'll try.</li>
		<li>Open an issue on the mod's issue tracker. It's okay if you don't have "an issue" and just want to ask a question, I don't mind. The issue tracker is usually linked on the mod's CurseForge page (unless I forgot). Unfortunately I cannot provide support for my old Forge 1.12 mods in this way.</li>
		<li>Ping me on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/quat1024" target="_blank">@quat1024</a>. Just @ me, it's totally fine, i don't really use DMs.</li>
		<li>I am experimenting with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#quat_mods:matrix.org">a Matrix room</a>, but I don't know how to use Matrix very well and don't check it very often.</li>
	</ul>
