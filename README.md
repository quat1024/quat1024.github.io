This is like 50% my website and 50% an excuse to play around with technology I find interesting.

Previously written in pure JS, previously previously written in Rust, previously previously previously a [dynamic web server](https://github.com/quat1024/quatweb)

## notes

locally serving with [miniserve](https://github.com/svenstaro/miniserve): `miniserve ./out --index index.html`, add `-v` for logspam (actually use `deno task serve` for that)
