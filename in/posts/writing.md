I'm not a very good communicator. Both in speech and in writing I tend to meander a lot. In writing I will also overuse bulleted lists and nested lists. (Sometimes people attribute that to ADHD which I think is funny.)

Ideas form a hyperbolic space, maybe? I feel like every idea connects to more related ideas than I can fit in linear text. Having clearer goals about what narrative specifically I want to communicate might help tame this.

Writing in a simpler and direct style is easier, it creates text that is easy to write but dry to read. I'll ham it up more for college papers, which is maybe another thing I shouldn't do. Could be years of "writing to hit a word count" catching up to me.

Many people have a vague "I want to write more" notion, myself included. The main reasons I haven't been writing more are that I don't feel I have interesting long-form thoughts to share, and my attention span has been suffering a lot lately. You can maybe see evidence of this in how I'm breaking everything up into tweet-sized paragraphs.

I haven't produced much writing I'm proud of. I used to think advice about "use fewer exclamation points" was tedious until reading back some of my earlier pieces. There's an "internet blogger-itis" to them, constantly trying to crack jokes and make "reveals" to coax people to keep reading. I hate reading this in other people's blogs, and then I go and write it. Frustrating and embarrassing.
