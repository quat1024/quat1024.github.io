A couple people in my circles have been posting about something called "December Adventure". ~~I can't find who started this or what it's about, but from some googling, the commonalities look like:~~

* you work a little bit on a creative project every day in December (or at least Dec 1 through 24 like an advent calendar)
* you blog about it,
* you *have fun doing it and don't burn yourself out* (important!)

Oh! [Found the blogger who started this last year](https://eli.li/december-adventure), think I got the vibe correct.

Historically my work ethic has been *miserable*, prone to faltering from things in my control (mood swings, distractions) and things less in my control (how physical health decides to treat me that day). I'm burned out of most of my existing projects. I've tried Advent of Code but when it gets difficult, I won't lie, it starts being a chore :(

A little bit of loose, for-fun structure and an excuse to try new things might help kick things back into gear, eh? The semester *is* coming to a close after all...

Here are some things I might work on this month?

* `i4`, a Minecraft content mod
* Minecraft tooling, primarily for `i4`
* `blanksky`, a Bluesky frontend and admittedly kind of a web frontend sandbox
* Writing blog posts about math or computing or whatever, maybe polishing up some old notes
  * If you're mean to me, you might get navel-gazy metablogging wankery. Noone wants that
* Whatever else I end up interested in?
