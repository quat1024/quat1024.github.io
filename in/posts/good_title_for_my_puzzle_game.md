I made a small Puzzlescript game! You can play it online [right here](https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=fb015aa143ae4b3c1f5923a8da1a14d1).

If you've never played a Puzzlescript game before, use the WASD or arrow keys to move the character and (in levels where it's present) use the X button or spacebar to activate and deactivate the thingie. Press Z to undo and R to reset the level. You can play it on mobile as well; slide to move the character and tap to toggle the device.

To access the source code, press the "hack" link on the bottom or go to the [gist](https://gist.github.com/quat1024/fb015aa143ae4b3c1f5923a8da1a14d1) where it's hosted.

Known bugs:

* You can delete crates by telefragging them. Shouldn't break anything, since you need the crates.
* You can push the device over pits.
* Pushing the device really close to the edges of the level will break the outline until you push it back, but most levels have a generous buffer zone so that can't happen

This is a prototype of something I'd like to make into a larger game outside of the Puzzlescript engine (and a lot of the bugs are because this mechanic is not especially Puzzlescript-shaped). I think it'd work well as a not-block-pushy game, like Portal. And I have some big ideas... idk. I would say "watch this space" but I have executive dysfunction
