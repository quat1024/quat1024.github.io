# Hello!

To go to my discord, [step right this way](https://discord.gg/WUXsbGH).

(This landing page exists because I periodically reroll the invite.)

## Other methods

If you don't want to use Discord:

* Open an issue on the mod's issue tracker. It's okay if you don't have "an issue" and just want to ask a question, I don't mind. The issue tracker is usually on GitHub and linked on the mod's CurseForge or Modrinth page. All my mods are open-source on Github. If there's no link, let me know.
* Email me: [quat@highlysuspect.agency](mailto:quat@highlysuspect.agency)

Unfortunately I probably cannot provide support for my old Forge 1.12 mods. I've forgotten how they work.

## Things you don't need to tell me about

I am well aware that Minecraft 1.21 is out. Please be patient.
