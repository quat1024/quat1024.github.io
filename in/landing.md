# Hey

I'm quaternary. I'm an undergrad at the Ohio State University.

I primarily write [Minecraft mods](https://www.curseforge.com/members/quat1024/projects), contribute to a third-party launcher, work on [tooling for decade-old Forge versions](https://github.com/CrackedPolishedBlackstoneBricksMC/voldeloom), and wrangle [terrible Gradle megaprojects](https://github.com/quat1024/AutoThirdPerson).

Also try some [Portal 2 tests](https://steamcommunity.com/id/quaternary/myworkshopfiles/) and look at [my photos](/photos) while you're here.
