background color: ffefef is feeling a little dark (lol),

* thinking about fcf4f2 (pleasant light orange)
* some blues: EBF4F5 (dark, for header) F4FBFC (lighter bg color)
* the blues but orange: light #fcf8f4 dark #F5EEEB

text color #000000 for contrast reasons, i dont see a reason to use something else

codeinlinebg: how about something like `rgba(40,0,0,0.15)`

Swap codeblockfg and codeblockbg? maybe give a left border to code blocks

## heading/title fonts

* [Source Serif Pro Black 900 Italic](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+Pro) would be a great title font. reduced font weights for other headers

## body fonts

* Source Serif Regular body font? well it matches
* [Besley](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Besley/) body font? has a "computer modern"ish feel lol
* [Yrsa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yrsa/) hmmm
* [Crimson Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Pro/)

I would like a serif font, or at least a not super neo-neo-grotesque geometric sans (I find those hard to read)

Definitely going to keep the larger-than-average font size for body text tho, probably about 20 to 22px, i like it being comfy and easy to read

## monospace fonts

* good ol [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata/)
	* currently this is the everything font, including the header
	* i should know that it has variable width axis (i did not know that), ive had issues with overfilling code blocks lol	
* [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono)
	* oh nice its on google fonts
	* this is the font i personally program with and i think it's a nice looking font
* [Noto Sans Mono](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+Mono/)
	* also variable width
	* not too "flashy"
