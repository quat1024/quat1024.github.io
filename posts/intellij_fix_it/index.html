<h1>Fix stuff being broke in IntelliJ</h1>
<div class="byline">quat, Jan 19, 2020<br/>
<a href="/tags/forge">forge</a> <a href="/tags/1.12">1.12</a> <a href="/tags/mc-modding">mc-modding</a> </div>

<p>This article was formerly published on my Github account <a href="https://gist.github.com/quat1024/8bf436c85e5c140d27d49a7dc6c09982/">here</a>. It was during a time when ForgeGradle didn’t work well with 1.12 mods. Since most users don’t mod 1.12 anymore, it’s mostly historical information, but I’ll leave it up in case someone finds a use for it.</p>
<hr/>
<h1>What</h1>
<p>When compiling mods in recent versions of IntelliJ, weird things start happening:</p>
<ul>
<li>With ForgeGradle 2 (1.12-), none of the assets show up in-game (language keys, models, textures etc)</li>
<li>Broken hotswapping.</li>
<li>Potentially other Bad, Terrible Things that are yet to be discovered.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How</h1>
<h2>Hotswapping is broken / Resources are broken</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open Settings (head to File -&gt; Settings).</li>
<li>Expand “Build, Execution, Deployment”.</li>
<li>Expand “Build Tools”.</li>
<li>Expand “Gradle”.</li>
<li>Under the right pane, under “Build and Run”, change both from “Gradle” to “IntelliJ Idea”.</li>
<li>Apply.</li>
<li>Restart IntelliJ (quick way: is File -&gt; Invalidate Caches / Restart -&gt; Just Restart)</li>
</ol>
<p>You will need to change this once for every project.</p>
<p>You also may have to set the project build directory after configuring this, since IntelliJ forgot; just use the <code>build/</code> directory (in the root of your project, adjacent to <code>src/</code>, probably already exists if you compiled it before).</p>
<h2>genIntelliJRuns-generated run configs are erroring</h2>
<p>(This probably doesn’t happen in 1.13+, but it certainly does in 1.12-)</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Run/Debug configurations dialog (expand the run configs dropdown -&gt; Edit Configurations…)</li>
<li>Under “Use classpath of module”, change it to the one that ends in “.main”</li>
<li>Do this for each run configuration.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Why</h1>
<p>IntelliJ changed its model of how Gradle tasks are executed. Resources get put in a different folder from where ForgeGradle expects to find them, hot-swapping doesn’t work, etc.</p>
<h1>Who</h1>
<p>Thanks to Tama for figuring out the resources issue on MMD. Thanks to Paul Fulham for pointing out that it also breaks hotswapping and by “pointing out” I mean that he found out the hard way and had to find out how to fix it. I’m just posting this somewhere I can link to it.</p>
