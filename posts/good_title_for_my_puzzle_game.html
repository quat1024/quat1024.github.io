<h1>Good title for my puzzle game</h1>

<p>I made a small Puzzlescript game! You can play it online <a href="https://www.puzzlescript.net/play.html?p=fb015aa143ae4b3c1f5923a8da1a14d1">right here</a>.</p>
<p>If you've never played a Puzzlescript game before, use the WASD or arrow keys to move the character and (in levels where it's present) use the X button or spacebar to activate and deactivate the thingie. Press Z to undo and R to reset the level. You can play it on mobile as well; slide to move the character and tap to toggle the device.</p>
<p>To access the source code, press the &quot;hack&quot; link on the bottom or go to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/quat1024/fb015aa143ae4b3c1f5923a8da1a14d1">gist</a> where it's hosted.</p>
<p>Known bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can delete crates by telefragging them. Shouldn't break anything, since you need the crates.</li>
<li>You can push the device over pits.</li>
<li>Pushing the device really close to the edges of the level will break the outline until you push it back, but most levels have a generous buffer zone so that can't happen</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a prototype of something I'd like to make into a larger game outside of the Puzzlescript engine (and a lot of the bugs are because this mechanic is not especially Puzzlescript-shaped). I think it'd work well as a not-block-pushy game, like Portal. And I have some big ideas... idk. I would say &quot;watch this space&quot; but I have executive dysfunction</p>
